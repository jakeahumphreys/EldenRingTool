# EldenRingTool
A Companion Tool for Elden Ring that utilises the Elden Ring Fansite API to fetch information about various ingame bosses or items. Written in C# .Net6 using MAUI / Blazor Hybrid for a multi-platform experience. I'm primarily focusing on the Windows Desktop platform for the time being as Blazor provides an easy UI framework using HTML / CSS with nested C#.
