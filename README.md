# Elden Ring Tool (Great title)
A Companion Tool for Elden Ring that utilises the Elden Ring Fansite API to fetch information about various ingame bosses or items. Written in C# .Net6 using MAUI / Blazor Hybrid for a multi-platform experience. I'm primarily focusing on the Windows Desktop platform for the time being as Blazor provides an easy UI framework using HTML / CSS with nested C#.

# Planned Features
* Offline / Online Mode
  * Offline will require an initial connection to the internet so the application can cache all the data it needs. Doing one performance intensive call to retrieve and cache all the required information will then make it super fast and offline for subsequent lookups.
